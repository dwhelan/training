# C#

This repository contains training exercises and katas in C#.

### Unit Tests
Unit tests use
[NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/) with [Fluent Assertions](http://www.fluentassertions.com/).

### Characterization Tests
Michael Feathers coined the term
[characterization tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test)
to refer to tests that capture how existing code works.
This is particularly useful when working with legacy code.
We will use [Approval tests](http://approvaltests.com/) to create and run characterization tests.

### Markdown
Markdown support is not built into Visual Studio. To enable better viewing of the kata instructions
you may want to install the
[Markdown Editor](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/eaab33c3-437b-4918-8354-872dfe5d1bfe)
plugin.
