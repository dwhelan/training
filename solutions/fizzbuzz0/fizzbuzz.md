# Fizzbuzz

## Background
Fizzbuzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.

Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by 3 with the word "fizz", any number divisible by 5 with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by 3 and 5 with the word "fizzbuzz". 

## Kata
Create a `fizBuzz(number : int) : string` method that returns a string according to the rules of Fizzbuzz:

 <table>
    <tr>
        <td>Input</td>
        <td>Output</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>"1"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>"2"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>"fizz"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>"4"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>"buzz"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>"fizzbuzz"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
    </tr>
</table>
