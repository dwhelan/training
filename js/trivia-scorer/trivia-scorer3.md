# Trivia Game Scorer 3
We want some questions to be worth more. A number counts for its value. All previous scenarios should still be supported.  
  
Examples:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Input</td>
        <td>Output</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>"5,10"</td>
        <td>15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>"Y,X,5"</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
</table>
