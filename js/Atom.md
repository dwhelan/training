## Running Tests
You can install the `mocha` package which will allow you to run mocha tests
within the IDE. Once you have installed the package you will need to configure
it to run the tests for the kata your are working on.

Go to the `mocha` package settings and change the `Spec Directory` setting to the
folder name of the kata you are working on e.g. `bowling`.
