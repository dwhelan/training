## `Training katas`
This Java project has starting source code and tests
for the katas along with a description markdown file.

It saves all IntelliJ workplace, project and dependencies locally.

### Getting started

At a terminal shell enter:

```
git clone https://github.com/dwhelan/training
```

Start IntelliJ and select menu `File` | `Open...` 
and choose the `training/java` folder created above.

Select menu `Run` | `Run...` | `All`.
You should see that all tests passed.

You should also see a run configuration for each kata that
you can use to run individual kata tests.
