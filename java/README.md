### `Training katas`
This Java project has starting source code and tests
for the katas along with a description markdown file.

It saves all IntelliJ workplace, project and dependencies locally.

#### Getting started
Make sure you have cloned the training repo.  
```
$ git clone git@gitlab.mtb.com:P2P/Training.git
```

Start IntelliJ and select menu `File` | `Open...` 
and choose the `training/java` folder created above.

Select menu `Run` | `Run...` | `All`.
You should see that all tests passed.

You should also see a run configuration for each kata that
you can use to run individual kata tests.

See [IntelliJ](./IntelliJ.md) for additional tips and shortcuts.
