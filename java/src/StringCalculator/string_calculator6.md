### Step 6 - negative nuumbers
Update `calculate` to throw an error if 
a negative number is detected. 
The exception message should have the text 
`negatives not allowed` as well as the negative value detected.

If there are multiple negative values, include all of them in the exception message.

All existing scenarios should still be supported.
