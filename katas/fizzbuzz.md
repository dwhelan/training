# Fizzbuzz

## Background
Fizzbuzz is a game for learning division.

Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by 3 with the word "fizz", any number divisible by 5 with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by 3 and 5 with the word "fizzbuzz". 

## Kata
Create a `fizbuzz(number)` method that takes an integer and 
returns a Fizzbuzz string:

| Number  | Fizzbuzz String     |
| ------- | ------------ |
| 1       | "1"          |
| 2       | "2"          |
| 3       | "fizz"       |
| 4       | "4"          |
| 5       | "buzz"       |
| 6       | "fizz"       |
| 7       | "7"          |
| 8       | "8"          |
| ...     | ...          |
| 15      | "fizzbuzz"   |
| ...     | ...          |
